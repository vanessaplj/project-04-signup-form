## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

- [How Can I Validate An Email Adress In Javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - This was the first time I've heard of Regex. They had a lot of examples there, so I chose one that was neither the simplest nor the most complex-looking, and I'm pleased with the results.
- [Adding Classes During Runtime To HTML Elements Not Working As Expected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61747017/adding-classes-during-runtime-to-html-elements-not-working-as-expected) - By reading about a problem similar to mine, I was able to figure out what I needed to make my form validation work.
